# Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula Submission
This project is part of the **Machine Learning for Beginners** course final project at Dicoding.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset from Dicoding Academy](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip).
## Technologies: 
TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab.
## Image Augmentation: 
Applied various image augmentation techniques (such as rotation, zoom, and flipping) to improve the generalization and performance of the model.
## Model: 
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using the **Sequential** API.
- Utilized multiple **Conv2D** layers for feature extraction.
- Added **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting and enhance model robustness.
## Performance: 
- **Training accuracy**: 96%
- **Validation accuracy**: 98%
# Model Application: 
This trained model can accurately predict newly uploaded images of rock, paper, or scissors.
